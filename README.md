# Code @ the Capitol
### A website similar to a photo gallery to allow legistators to take pictures of the demo and write their own code to display the picture, write their name, and a caption or description under the photo as a hello world. This website uses DaisyUI and TailwindCSS like cshsboltbots.org. The University at Texas at Austin's CS WeTeach program sponsored the event.
